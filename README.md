🧠 How It Works
Backend (Express):

Starts a local server at http://localhost:5000.
Serves a list of products from /products.
Frontend (HTML + JS):

Uses Axios to send a GET request to the Express API.
Displays products with their names and prices.
Shows loading and error states.
🛠️ How to Run
1️⃣ Setup Backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express cors
node server.js
